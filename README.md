# Introduction
**Open The Page in Windows for The Best Experience**
This is a page for those who wanted to know my previous work, all combined and bundled into a website. If you are a recruiter, you may find this useful, and do not hesitate to reach me out if you find what you see interesting. 

Project was done by using pure HTML CSS and JS, without any frameworks, so any inconsistent RWD might be the result of oversight due to the project doesn't use any frameworks. 

Q&A:
1. Why don't you use frameworks?
   - I'm trying to learn the fundamentals of web design first, this project highlights of what I can do with the vanilla web design.

2. Would this project be updated? If so when?
   - Yes, but not in the near future, usually near the end of my career for highlighting the achievements that I accomplish within the company, I won't update it too often due to the volatile nature of any workplace or future workplace.

3. I have a suggestion or questions with the design.
   - Suggestions are highly anticipated, even the most basic things such as: "I think the color pallete doesn't suit me". You may contact me through one of my socials attached in the page.

Another things to note, that may answer the related questions that you may ask:
1. Yes, the RWD is currently at the state of requiring much attention, and I am currently designing a UI that would fit the need and comfortability of those who sees it.
2. Because I am still learning, the updates would be significantly at a slower pace.
3. Yes I am open to any usable frameworks as long as you are willing to teach me a thing or two.
